# Vehicle & People Count 

Following is intended to support video analysis of (counting) people or cars. The code uses pre-defined TenserFlow 
models created by third-parties.
* [people.tflite](../../data/models/people.tflite) - model used for analyzing number of people in a video
* [vehicle.tflite](../../data/models/vehicle.tflite) - model used for analyzing number of cars in a video. 

Videos can be found in [data dir](../../data)
* [car videos](../../data/videos)
* [people videos](../../data/edgex-demo)

## Requirements 
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) 
* [opencv-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

## How Code Works 
[Video Processing](video_processing.py) analyzes videos and provides insight about it. 
* [process_video](video_processing.py#L152) method takes a video (of traffic), counts the number of vehicles and calculates
the average car speed. 
* [analyze_data](video_processing.py#L248) method takes a video (of people/CCTV), and counts the number of people in the 
video.
* [get_values](video_processing.py#L287) method returns results generated by either process_video or analyze_data. 
    * `process_video` method - `self.obj_count` is the number of cars | `self.confidence` calculated average speed
    * `analyze_data` method - `self.obj_count` is the number of people | `self.confidence` is the accuracy of the results
